#!/bin/sh
# Build speech as a command-line binary.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh                   # produces build/speech (arm64, ad-hoc signed)
#   ./build.sh arm64|x86_64|universal
#
# Mirrors pdfutil's and langid's build.sh deliberately - same contract, same
# shape, so an applet's update script treats every helper identically. The
# contract downstream is build/speech: an ad-hoc signed binary at a fixed path.
# Keep that path and the CLI stable.
#
# arm64 by default rather than universal, which is where this diverges from
# pdfutil. Two of the three planned engines are Apple Silicon only - FluidAudio
# ships CoreML packages for the ANE, and transcribe.cpp's Metal backend is the
# only one worth shipping - so an x86_64 slice would be a binary that builds and
# then cannot run a single third-party model. The other architectures still
# build on request, for anyone who only wants the Apple engines.
#
# Always an optimized release build; the compiler flags are SwiftPM's business
# (see Package.swift). This script only picks architectures, strips and signs.
